--   Users work only with one type. They get AND and OR combinators,

-- writing to be possible!

-- Ok, we'll define Conjunct and Disjunct in one file, intended for use by
-- the interpreter writers. Then, we'll define Comprehension, intended for
-- use by the program writers.

-- function into here. Not possible!
-- Perhaps shoot this one out to Haskell Caf√©?
